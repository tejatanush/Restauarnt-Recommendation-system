# Restauarnt-Recommendation-system
The Collaborative-Based Restaurant Recommendation System is designed to provide personalized dining suggestions by leveraging user interaction data. This system uses collaborative filtering, a technique that predicts a user's preferences by analyzing the preferences of similar users. By collecting user ratings and reviews of various restaurants, the model identifies patterns and similarities between users' tastes.

### Applications  
* A restaurant recommendation system in food delivery apps helps users discover new dining options 
  based on their past orders, ratings, and preferences. By analyzing user behavior and preferences, 
  the system suggests restaurants that the user is likely to enjoy, leading to more satisfying meal 
  choices and encouraging repeat orders.
* In platforms that aggregate restaurant reviews, a recommendation system can suggest new dining 
  places based on user reviews, ratings, and browsing history. This makes it easier for users to find 
  restaurants that match their tastes and explore options they might not have considered otherwise.
* A restaurant recommendation system in tourism apps can assist travelers in finding popular local 
  eateries that align with their cuisine preferences and dining habits. It can also recommend 
  restaurants based on proximity, reviews, and other tourists' preferences.
